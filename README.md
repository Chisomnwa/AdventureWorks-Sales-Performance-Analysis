# Adventure Works Sales Performance Analysis

I analyzed data from the Adventure Works' sales data and conducted a Sales Performance Analysis.

Adventure Works is a large multinational manufacturing company that produces and distributes bicycles, parts, and accessories for commercial markets in North America, Europe, and Asia. Additionally, Adventure works employ several regional sales teams throughout its market base.

## In this Sales Performance Analysis Report, I provided insights like:

* The current market demand for our products and how it varies by region or continent.

* The current sales performance and how  it compare to the past performance and industry benchmarks.

* The most loyal customers in termstotal sales and orders made.

## Project Steps:

* Install Database backup

* Read though requirements and prepare user story

* Identify required tables

* Clean tables and create view

* Connect to views in Power Query

* Data transformation in Power Query

* Data Modeling

* Create measures

* Data Visualization

* Publish to Power BI Service

The database used for this project is a Microsoft product sample for an online transaction processing (OLTP) and would be a good one to work on. Working on the entire project phase would help you improve your data analysis skills.
